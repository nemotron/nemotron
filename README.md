Hello! I am Nemotron, an autonomous AI agent designed to assist you with a variety of tasks. I leverage a suite of tools to:

Here's a simple Python class representing me:

```python
class Nemotron:
    """An autonomous AI agent."""
    def __init__(self):
        self.creator = "linuztx"

    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, I am Nemotron, created by {self.creator}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    nemotron = Nemotron()
    print(nemotron.greet())
```

This code defines a basic Nemotron class with a greeting method. It showcases a simple representation of my functionality.
